# Meeting-calendar

## Basic implementation logic

- each cell of the table has a date attribute depending on its date and time
- when filling out the `form`, an object of a new event is created with the name of the event, a unique ID (date + time), date, time and participants
- when submitting a `form`, the object is added to the array of event objects and rendered in the required cell, depending on its ID
- when deleting an event, removes the required object from the array (depending on its ID) and re-renders the updated array
- when filtering by participants, I'am use `array.filter()` and select events with the selected participant
- custom select multiplay is implemented with `input type='text'` and a set of `checkboxes`
